## My Jekyll Styling Experience

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/rocks-vietnam.jpeg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

**What parts were new to you?**
  -Everything was new to me. I chose [Massively](https://github.com/jekyllup/jekyll-theme-massively). The concept of overriding the default jekyll theme was not as clear cut as I thought would be. I was also caught by surprise by how much I had to modify.

**What parts did you struggle with**
  -I struggled with making sure to copy all the necessary files into my original blog and incorporate the theme by changing up elements within my original blog to fit the format of the theme.

**What parts still do not make sense?**
  -Is copying and pasting files the only way to [override](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) the default theme in jekyll? I wish there were an easier way that I knew. I also wonder if we need to change up the html or css file or we just continue to use markdown language. Also, it would help to know how to edit the newly themed site.

**What are you looking forward to?**
  -I look forward to making strides in overriding the default jekyll theme and being able to tinker with the elements of the new theme format.
