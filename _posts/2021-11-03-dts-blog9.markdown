## Update on Disco Tray Studios and life experiences

**Good Vibes Flutter App**
  1. I have not had much time this week to work on shared preferences since that is the only part I need to finish the dark mode theme. I am hoping to get that done in our meeting today.


**Playing the New Games**
  1. Climate Goes Political
  - The music matches the game
  - Nice transitions
  - Button clicks has sounds that are intuitive
  - I would recommend having an option to turn off music but keep clicks on or vice versa
  2. Chem Sim
  - I can see the molecules so much better
  - Sounds that occur when the valid reactants are placed is intuitive
  3. Astronomical Bodies
  - Super fun to try
  - I like that you can change the settings of each planet on the left side
  - You can hide the panel to see the full view of your astronomical bodies


**New Changes In My Life?**
  1. This week my anxieties about my capstone projects have been calmed. I realize that ultimately I want to showcase my ability to pick up new tools and learn to use them effectively. I need to work on how to explain my thought process to people in a way that they are able to understand. 
  2. I have been looking for new places to live in Little Rock and planning my move in late December. I think I found the perfect place -- it is very cute and homey!
