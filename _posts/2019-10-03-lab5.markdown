**What did I assume?**
  -I assumed that sellers and buyers were only linked through items. So, a seller lists his/her item(s), in which the two is connected by a seller ID and an Item ID. The only thing I would change in Vertabelo is the cardinality between many of the entities. There can be one seller to many items. I also assumed that one customer can have many bid numbers but can only bid one at a time, therefore, price is a primary key in bids.

**What did I miss?**
  -I wish I had added another entity called "auction" since the seller has to pay a fee to the auction when an item sells. Auction would also be a connection between sellers and buyers.

**Thoughts, Questions, Concerns?**
  -I am still worried that I may not understand data modeling to the extent I want to be. Therefore, I will speak with Dr. Goadrich during office hours to hopefully get myself situated with this lab. I understand everything up to the point of cardinality. I understand that there is not one right answer.
