## My Setup Experience

1. What parts were new to you?
    1. Using the terminal as a tool to direct to my [Github directory](https://github.com/nguyenvvv/csci340blog) and installing ruby and jekyll. Another new part was using markdown language to make my first blog post.
2. What parts did you struggle with
    1. I definitely struggled with using the terminal but easily got help from my CSCI340 professor, [Dr. Goadrich](http://mark.goadrich.com/index.html). I also struggled with my local server and not quitting out of terminal.
3. What parts still do not make sense?
    1. So far, I understand the task at hand and do not have any more questions. However, I would like to know more about the Ruby language and why do I need to run both Ruby and Jekyll? If that makes sense. I hear these terms but I do not necessarily understand them.
4. What are you looking forward to?
    1. I look forward to learning new languages and getting used to using Github pages.
