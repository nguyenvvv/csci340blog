## About Me!

<span class="image fit"><img src="{{ "/images/aboutme.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Hi! My name is Vi Nguyen and I am currently a sophomore at [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu/). I am pursuing a major in Computer Science. When I am not at school, I enjoy traveling and spending time with friends and family. 

<div class="box">
	<blockquote>Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.</blockquote>

I hope to always continue learning and to let that drive me beyond the fleeting pleasures of the world.
